Overview

This project involves analyzing two real-world datasets using Tableau to create interactive visualizations, dashboards, and a story that highlight key insights. The project is divided into two parts:

Part 1: COVID-19 Data Analysis


Objective

Analyze historic COVID-19 data and vaccination data to identify trends and key indicators, and present insights through interactive dashboards and a story.

Datasets

COVID-19 Historical Data – curated by The Atlantic. Contains country-level COVID-19 statistics over time.

Vaccination Data – contains vaccination numbers by country and manufacturer.

Tasks Completed

Identified two key indicators (e.g., hospitalizations and cases).

Created three visualizations per key indicator, including line charts and trend analyses.

Developed interactive dashboards combining the visualizations.

Created a geo-map dashboard using vaccination data with filters for location and vaccine type.

Developed a Tableau Story that illustrates the progression of the pandemic using the dashboards.
